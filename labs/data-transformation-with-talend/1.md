# **Data Transformation from DLP using Talend**

# **Introduction about Transformation**
Data transformation is the process of converting data or information from one format to another, 
usually from the format of a source system into the required format of a new destination system. Transformation is an idea to convert 
data from one format to another more meaningful format. 

# **Lab Overview**
In our learning lab, we are trying to use Talend Open Source Big data tool to perform transformation operation on CSV data file and save the 
data directly to Hadoop platform. Source data should be selected from DLP¡¯s Hadoop platform and the respective transformation would be applied from 
DLP¡¯s browser. In this learning lab, we will learn the transformation operation in below ways:  </br>

A)	Develop transformation function from Talend Open studio for Big Data tool. </br>
B)	Upload transformation job in DLP platform. </br>
C)	Execute transformation job from DLP platform. </br>

# **Lab Overview**
1)	Creating Transformation job on Talend Big Data Tool.
2)	Managing (Upload, Delete, Share) Talend job in DLP platform.
3)	Visualize transformed data from Hadoop platform.

We need to follow the below steps to create the transformation using Talend Open  Source Big Data tool

# ** (A)Develop transformation function from Talend Open studio for Big Data tool**
In this step, we will learn the process of developing Talend job. 

In this step, we will learn the process of developing Talend job.
