# **Data Transformation from DLP using Talend**

# **Introduction about Transformation**
<b>Data transformation</b> is the process of converting data or information from one format to another, usually from the format of a source system into the required format of a new destination system. 

# **Lab Overview**
In our learning lab, we are trying to use Talend Open Source Big data tool to perform transformation operation on CSV data file and save the data directly to Hadoop platform. Source data should be selected from DLP's Hadoop platform and the respective transformation would be applied from DLP's browser. In this learning lab, we will learn the transformation operation in below ways:  </br>

Section A: Download and Install Talend Open Studio for Big Data tool.</br>
Section B: Develop a Transformation Job using Talend Open Studio for Big Data Tool in user's local computer. </br>
Section C: Build Transformation Job using Talend Big Data Tool in user's local computer. </br>
Section D: Upload the transformation job in DLP platform and execute transformation and view and visualize the transformed data.</br>

# **Lab Overview**
1)	Using Talend Open Source Big Data Tool to create a ETL(Extraction, Transformation and Load) Job. </br>
2)	Managing (Upload, Execute, Delete, Share) Talend jobs from DLP platform. </br>
3)	Visualize transformed data from DLP platform. </br>

# **Prerequisites**
1) User must have to know the basic knowledgre of ETL.
2) Java 1.7+ should be pre-installed in User's computer.
3) Proper internet connectivity with User's computer.

<b>N.B:</b> In below, each section(Section A, B,C,D) are describing in details in step wise manner. User need to follow each step carefully.

**Section A: Download and Install Talend Open Studio for Big Data tool.**
Step 1: Check that Java in user's computer.
For executing Talend, JDK is required and need to be pre-installed in user's computer. Use the command(Java -version) in the command prompt. This command will show the JDK version installed in user's computer if Java is pre-installed already.
