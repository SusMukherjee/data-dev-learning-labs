# **Basic data visualization using Apache Zeppelin**

# **Introduction about Apache Zeppelin**
Zeppeline A web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. You can make beautiful data-driven, interactive and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more. </br>

Interactive browser-based notebooks enable data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organizing, executing, and sharing data code and visualizing results without referring to the command line or knowing the cluster details. Notebooks allow users to not only execute but also interactively work with long workflows. Zeppelin provides a &quot;Modern Data Science Studio&quot; that supports Spark and Hive out of the box. In addition, Zeppelin supports multiple languages in back-end, with a growing ecosystem of data sources. Zeppelin notebooks provide interactive snippet-at-time experiences to data scientists.

## Step 2: Create Zeppelin development environment </br>
1. Above steps will Zeppelin home page. We need to create our own notebook by clicking on <b>Create new note</b> link.

2. Create a notebook with a new name in the pop-up dialog box. 
Input a valid name based on your choice and click on the <b>Creat Note</b> button.

<b>*Upto this steps, we have created our environment on Zeppelin. Now we will try to use some Python functions and view the output directly from Zeppelin. Python is already installed in out DLP platform. In our example code, we will try to view the Cosine signal data.*</b>

## Step 3: Create cosine signal data.
1. Import numpy library from Zeppelin UI. </br>
*Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python. It contains very powerful mathematical functions. In this learning lab, we will use the function that is defined in Numpy to create cosine signal data. Before we use these functions, we should import Numpy library.* </br>
From the Zeppelin UI, write the below code and click on the <b>Run</b> button. Follow the below screen.

```json
%python
import numpy as np
```
![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image7Importnumpy.png?raw=true)

After successful importing numpy library into the work space. No error messages will appear if there is no error in importing the library.

2. Create Cosign Signal data.
Define a numpy array which should be eventually distributed alone (-2 * Pi, 2 * Pi). The syntax of numpy.linspace is as below.

numpy.linspace(start, stop, num=50, endpoint=True, retstep=False, dtype=None)[source]
Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.
Returns num evenly spaced samples, calculated over the interval [start, stop].
Paste the below code in Zeppelin IDE and execute the code by clicking on the <b>Run</b> button.
``` json
%python
x = np.linspace( -np.pi, np.pi , 1000)
```

</br>
3. Define an array y=cos(x)
   Please copy the below code to the notebook and then click run button
   ```json
   %python
   y = np.cos(x)
   ```

## Step 4: Plot the cosine signal.
In the previous step, we have created the cosine signal data. Now we need to plot the cosine signal data. <b>Matplotlib</b> is a python 2D plotting library that produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. In this learning lab, we will use the function of Matplotlib library to plot the figure. Before we use these functions, we should import Matplotlib. </br>

   1. Import Matplotlib library in Zeppelin.
   ```json
      %python
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```
   ![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image11numpyplot.PNG?raw=true)
   2. Plot the cosine signal in memory.
   ```json
        %python
        plt.plot(x,y)
   ```
   ![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image12numpyplot1.PNG?raw=true)
   3. Import StringIO library for saving figure in memory
   ```json
     %python
     import StringIO
   ```
   ![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image13numpyplot2.PNG?raw=true)
   4. Create StringIO object which named img.
   ```json
     %python
     img = StringIO.StringIO()
   ```
   ![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image14numpyplot3.PNG?raw=true)
   5. Save the figure in svg format.
   ```json
      %python
      plt.savefig(img, format='svg')
   ```
   ![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image15numpyplot4.PNG?raw=true)
   6. Get the memory of this figure.
   ```json
      %python
     img.seek(0)
   ```
   ![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image16numpyplot5.PNG?raw=true)
   7. Show the cosine signal in Zeppelin.
   ```json
       %python
       print '%html ' + img.buf
   ```
      ![alt-img](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-visualization-with-zeppelin/assets/images/image17numpyplot6.PNG?raw=true)
