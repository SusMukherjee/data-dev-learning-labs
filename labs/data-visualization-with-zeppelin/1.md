# **Basic data visualization using Apache Zeppelin**

# **Introduction about Apache Zeppelin**
Zeppeline A web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. You can make beautiful data-driven, interactive and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more. </br>

Interactive browser-based notebooks enable data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organizing, executing, and sharing data code and visualizing results without referring to the command line or knowing the cluster details. Notebooks allow users to not only execute but also interactively work with long workflows. Zeppelin provides a &quot;Modern Data Science Studio&quot; that supports Spark and Hive out of the box. In addition, Zeppelin supports multiple languages in back-end, with a growing ecosystem of data sources. Zeppelin notebooks provide interactive snippet-at-time experiences to data scientists.
