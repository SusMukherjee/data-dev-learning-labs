## Lab Overview

In this Learning Lab, you will learn how to develop CSA custom handlers for using CSA in our DLP platform.<br>
Our platform has Kafka messaging framework working from backend. This utility will take the IP, Port and the Topic details of Kafka messaging system. The application will listen to a local socket continuously and will push the stream from this socket to the Kafka. Our sample Java code for handling the log data stream. This java file need to mention in the XML configuration file.

### Now we are going to demo for a web server log Analysis step by step.

In this Web Server Log Analysis demo, we are going to use a Log Simulator, CSA Engine and the customized handler. First we need to create the environment. For creating environment, we need to start the Log simulator and CSA engine. This can be done through the configuration file which will build the handler.
Basically the full process we can split in 3 major sections.

</br>
* Section A: Setup The CSA Engine and Log Simulator.
* Section B: Codeing and configure the customized CSA Handler.
* Section C: The Visualization section with Zeppelin.

### Section A: Setup The CSA Engine and Log Simulator

<b>Step 1:</b> Explore Data Learning Platform(DLP)

<b>Step 4:</b> After creating the stack, drag and drop the below components from source library.<br> 
    1) Log simulator </br>
    2) TruCQ
![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/stackConfig.PNG?raw=true)


<b>N.B</b> If you can't find <b>LogSimulator</b>, <b>TrueCQ</b> under <b>DataSource List</b> it means that the services are not available. In this case, please click on the <b>Micro Service Hub</b> and then click on <b>DevNet Docker</b> tab. Select truecq and select "Add to My Service List". Please follow the below screen shot.
</br><b>Micrservice Hub->DevNet Docker</b> </br>
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/SelectmicroService.png?raw=true) </br>
<b>Follow same process for selection of Logsimulator</b>

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/CSA_5.png?raw=true) 


Now configure the Kafka topic in log simulator and Trucq for CSA.<br>

#### (i) Log Simulator we need to configure Kafka Ip ,Port and Topic the configuration will be the following.
```
IP : 172.16.10.10
PORT : 9092
TOPIC : CiscoDDP
```

N.B : System will provide all this configuration automatically.

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/CSA-TaglogSimulator.png?raw=true)

#### (ii) Trucq configuration will be the following.
```
Memory(MB) : 1024     // We suggest to give minimum 512 MB menory size for CSA Engine.
Countainer Port : 5432  TCP   // Please add a container port to access the CSA Engine by SQL Commands.
Tips : 5432 is default working port of Trucq CSA Engine.
```
</br>
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/CSA_3.png?raw=true)

<b>Step 6:</b> Now we need to start both of this micro service..<br> Click on the <b>Stack Library</b>
![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/StartService.PNG?raw=true)

Click on the Green arrow button for starting both the micro services.

Running state of two micro services:
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/CSA_6.png?raw=true)

<b>Step 7:</b> After running Trucq, we will get IP and port. The First IP and port for SQL query to CSA Engine those will vary in every startup.</br>
For example:</br>

```
     10.10.10.92:11841	    // 11841 is the SQL query Listener Port
```
N.B : This IP and Port will be required in <b>Step 12 and Step 17</b>

### Section B: Writing the customized CSA Handler and configurations

<b>Step 8:</b> <b>Select CSA customize handler "wksp-csa-handler"</b> and click on <b>"Launch"</b>
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/CSAWorkSpaceSelection.PNG?raw=true)

On clicking on <b>Launch</b> button, the IDE will be launched based on workspace.
![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/csa-IDE.PNG?raw=true)

<b>Step 9:</b> All the basic configurations are written in “include-handler.xml” file. Find this file in below location: <b>CsaCustomHandler-->build-->tmp-->include-handler.xml.</b> Double click on it and open it in right panel.<br>

![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/csa-includehandler.PNG?raw=true)

<b>Step 10:</b> In the “include-handler.xml” file set the kafka Topic and Kafka Zookeeper IP and Port and change the name of the custom class which we are going to develop. Here handler java class name is ETLHandler.java.

```
	<topic>CiscoDDP</topic>     // Change the Kafka Topic here.
	<arguments>
 		<arg name="zookeeper.connect">172.16.11.10:2181/kafka</arg>  //Configure IP & Port
	</arguments>
	<custom class="custom.handlers.ETLHandler” </custom>        
	//Set the Handler Java Class which we are going to code next step
```

<b>Step 11 :</b> Sample Java class for CSA handler is placed in below path. Here we named it as ETLHandler.<br>
<b>CsaCustomHandler --> customizations --> src --> ETLHandler.java </b>

![alt-tag](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ETLHandlerClass.PNG?raw=true)

<b><u>Sample Coding Exercise</u></b><br>

```
package custom.handlers;

import org.apache.commons.configuration.SubnodeConfiguration;
import com.cisco.pa.handlers.model.DataRecord;
import com.truviso.system.handlers.AbstractEntryHanlder;
import com.truviso.system.handlers.HandlerException;

public class ETLHandler extends AbstractEntryHanlder<DataRecord, DataRecord> {
	String string;
	public ETLHandler(SubnodeConfiguration c) {
		super(c);
	}
	@Override
	public void init() throws HandlerException {
		super.init();
        try {
        	string = config.getString("string", "POST");
               } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {}
	}
	@Override
	public void handle(DataRecord record) throws HandlerException {

		try {
			if (null != record) {
				if (record.toString().contains(string))
					resultListener.handle(record);
			}

		      } catch (Exception ex) {throw new HandlerException(ex);}}}
```



<b>Step 12:</b> Above Truecq IP and Port number details are required to set the handler. We need to update the configuration file.<br> Open the IDE and double click on the below file

<b>CsaCustomHandler-->customizations-->instances-->local-runtime.properties</b></br>
We will get the Trucq port number from <b>Step 7</b>

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/aaaaa.png?raw=true)

<b>Step 13:</b>In this step we need to stop the handler first. In the top of the IDE we can select stop from the combo. 
![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/step13.jpg?raw=true)

<b>Step 14:</b>In this step we need to build our handler. In the top of the IDE we can select build from the combo.
![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/step14.jpg?raw=true)

![Figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/step15.jpg)

### Section C: The Visualization section with Zeppelin.

<b>Step 16:</b> Now we can start Zeppelin for visualization. In the Data Repository we will get the  </>Drill button.</br>
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ZepplineSelection.PNG?raw=true)

1. In the popup frame with Zeppelin and Jupyter as options, click Zeppelin.
2. Follow the pop-out chrome page to begin the interactive analysis and visualization using Zeppelin

![alt-tag](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/selectZappline.PNG?raw=true)

Browser may block Zeppline. In this case, allow browser to open Zeppelin by selecting the <b>Always allow pop-up from http://128.107.70.74</b> and click on <b>Done</b> button.
<b>IP address may differ based on server</b>
![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/popUpBlockerAllowed.PNG?raw=true)
3. On allowing popup blocker, Zeppelin notebook will open in another tab.
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/welcome-to-zeppelin.png?raw=true)


Note: You can use the top-right tool buttons to do corresponding configurations (e.g., set paragraph width, copy visual report link, etc.) when necessary.

<b>Step 17:</b> We need to configure Zeppelin. When the Trucq micro service is running, we need to collect the IP and Port from the End Point for SQL query listener.</br>
We will get the Trucq port number from <b>Step 7</b>
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/CSA_4.png?raw=true)

Now we need to create a new Zeppelin Notebook for CSA and edit the PSQL configuration with below mentioned parameters.<br>

Click <b>Interpreter</b> from Zepplin and reach <b>psql</b> section. After clicking on <b>Edit</b> button, edit the respective details given in below and click on <b>Save</b> button. 
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ZapplineConfigurationRestartImage.png?raw=true) </br>

```
postgresql.driver.name    :  org.postgresql.Driver
postgresql.max.result     :  1000
postgresql.password	  : 
postgresql.url		  :  jdbc:postgresql://10.10.10.92:11841/cqdb
postgresql.user	          :  trucq

```

After clicking on <b>Save</b> button, click the <b>OK</b> button for final updation. </br>
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ZapplineConfigurationUpdate.PNG?raw=true)

After setting the above value, click on the <b>Restart</b> button.
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ZapplineConfigurationRe.PNG?raw=true) </br>
<b>Above settings in Zeppelin, helps to configure it with Postgresql database. We can apply SQL queries on Zeppelin for interacting with Postgresql database and display output in graphical format. We need to configure a Zeppelin notbook editor where we can insert SQL queries. Below steps describe the process of configuring Zeppelin notebook.</b> 
</br></br>
<b> Develop in Zeppelin notebook. </b>

1. On the Zeppelin homepage, create your own notebook by click on &quot;Create new note&quot;.
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/welcome-to-zeppelin-notebook.png?raw=true)

2. Create and name your new notebook in the pop up dialog.
![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/create-note.png?raw=true)

3. In your newly created notebook, a typical Zeppelin interactive development and visualization working environment.

![alt-tag](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/ZapplineIntf.PNG?raw=true)


<b>Step 18:</b> After restarting the configuration we can execute the SQL queries to the CSA engine and plot the graph according to data stream. 
Till now, we have configured the process of reading log data from multiple Web servers located in different location. In below, we will do the query to view the log data using sql query on web server's log data which are stored in postgresql database(configured in above steps). User can learn the process of log status from log data using sql query and display the data in different format(table/graph) as per their choice. 

```
%psql
select * from apachelog.sapachelog_archive order by access_time DESC limit 300
```
Input above sql query in te Zeppelin and execute the query by clicking on the Execute button(marked with Red color box).
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/sqlinZeppelin.PNG?raw=true)

This query will show the output as below. It is showing the web server's log server data from CSA engine. These log data are stored in the postgresql database which is mentioned in above step. 
![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/ZepplinePreview.png?raw=true)

On clicking on the Settings icon(marked in above image), we can drag and drop the fields as mentioned in below screen and display the output as graph format. User can change the graph based on their choice. 
![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/develop-stream-handler-cisco-csa/assets/images/zeppelinSqlQurery.png?raw=true)


### Things to Try

Developers can build their own application for the Run Time Visualization, CSA engine or Trucq support Restful web services and also support SQL queries to fetch the data from the Engine.
