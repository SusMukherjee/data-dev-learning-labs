# Step 2: Developing code in IDE
a) On selecting the Workspace and clicking on the Launch button, IDE will open in your browser. Double click on TransformData.java file which will open in right panel. </br>
Here the sample code is given for network data ingestion. User can edit the code and build and execute the program.

Below steps are describing the process of packaging and runing the sample program. 

b) Select the <b>package</b> and click on <b>Blue</b> button to build. 
   After successful build process, change it to <b>run</b> and then click on <b>Blue</b> button again.

After successful packaging, change it to <b>Run</b> and click on blue button. This process will generate the output and save the result file in HDFS platform.

# Step 3: Run the Program
Below steps describe the process of generating and saving output from the above program in hadoop platform. 
a)	Select the <b>run.sh</b> file from laft panel and double click on it. The content of this file will open in right panel.
There are three parameters mentioned in this script file. Change the values as described in below and select <b>run</b> and click the execute button to execute the script. </br>
* USER: your current login user name </br>
<b>N.B</b> Enter your login userid. If you login as user_1 then enter user_1 here as USER. </br>
* INPUT: The file name in “Data Repository” section which you want to transform. </br>
<b>N.B:</b> Sample preloaded network data (network_origin.csv) is already saved in HDFS environment. User can use this file for learning purpose. </br>
* OUTPUT: The output file name that your code will generate.  </br>
<b>N.B</b> Enter any name as an output file name. For example, network_transform_result.csv is used as a output file name. Output of the program would be saved in this file and the file would be saved in Hadoop environment directly.

N.B: final state: SUCCEEDED indicate that the script ran successfully by the IDE.

After executing the above script, DLP's Cloud IDE will generate the output file and saved directly in the Hadoop platform. We can view the output file using visualization tool called Tableau.
